        <h1> Sketching and Wireframing </h1>
        <h2> Pre-Design Thinking </h2>
        <p> We chose to design a webpage for the startup Float Health, which aims to be an
            Uber-like website where users can request a nurse to come to their home. When
            thinking about what kind of interface to design, we primarily thought about
            the probable users for this startup. Since people who would need a nurse to
            come to their home are probably older, we decided a desktop webpage would be a better
            design choice, rather than a mobile site. </p>
        <h2> Sketching </h2>
        <p> We first started brainstorming about the various ways the website could look. The
        following 4 designs are quick sketches of a Float Health website.</p>
        <h3> Design 1 </h3>

        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> The task we gave the UserTesting participants was to login to our site, try to book an appointment, and to confirm the appointment.  The results with respect to the users completing our task were as expected and were 100% successful in terms of task completion.  The main task was to make an appointment and the subtasks were to login, book an appointment, and confirm it.  The only error that was recorded was that one of the users mistakenly clicked the "I am a Patient" button which took them to their patient profile page and so they had to click logout in order to get back to the homepage and eventually click the 'login' button to successfully complete the task.  In general, all three users did a wonderful job on the task. <br> <br>

            Regarding the changes we would to our potential interface based on our UserTesting results and feedback include the following: centering the 'Book an Appointment' subtitle on the appointment page, adding availability to the patient-facing calendar shown on our 'book an appointment page', renaming the "I am a Patient" button to "Patient Sign Up", removing the profile picture and the update profile picture button, making it overtly obvious on the homepage that our service is sending nurses to people through appointment booking (Uber for Nurses), changing the submit button functionality to take the user to their profile page instead of the homepage, and finally we would clarify the background coloration and highlighting of the appointment needs options on the 'Book an Appointment' by deleting it wholesale.
